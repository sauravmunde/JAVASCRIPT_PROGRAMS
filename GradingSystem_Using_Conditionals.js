/*
Problem statement
You are required to implement a grading system for a school based on the marks obtained by students in a test. The goal is to write a JavaScript program that determines the grade of a student using conditional statements.



The grades will be assigned in the result variable based on the following criteria:
1- If the value of the marks variable is greater than or equal to 90, the value of the result variable should be "A grade"
2- If the marks are between 80 and 89, the value of the result variable should be "B grade".
3- If the marks are between 70 and 79, the value of the result variable should be "C grade".
4- If the marks are between 60 and 69, the value of the result variable should be "D grade".
5- If the marks are less than 60, the value of the result variable should be "F grade".

      result = " B grade "

    }else if ( marks >= 70 && marks <= 79 ){

       result = " C grade "

    }else if ( marks >= 60  && marks <= 69 ){

       result = " D grade "

    }else{

      result = "F grade"

    }

return result;

let marks = 88;

console.log(gradientSystem(marks));
